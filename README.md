# COSC-2030-SP25-File-Input-and-Output

Predict and Run:  In the first part, open and run the predict file.  Try to examine what is happening overall.  Also think about what the << operator is doing.   There are some questions to answer to yourself in that file.

Investigate:  Similar to the first part, let's investigate the file I/O operations some more.  Instead of input, we examine output.  Have a look in the file that gets created!    Make sure to keep an eye on the file system explorer of your workspace while you run this!

Modify:  In this very similar file, we will have you do a little programming of these functions yourself.  Have a look at how the input file is read here.

Make:  Here we have our file for the actual homework.  Implement the file input, reading, and output.  This is the homework you'll turn in!  

Turn in all of the files necessary to run your code in a zip file and submit that to this assignment page.
